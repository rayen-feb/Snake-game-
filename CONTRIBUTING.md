We Develop with Github 🌐
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

We Use Github Flow 🔄
So all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
If you’ve added code that should be tested, add tests.
If you’ve changed APIs, update the documentation.
Ensure the test suite passes.
Make sure your code lints.
Issue that pull request!
Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that’s a concern.

Report bugs using Github’s issues 🐞
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it’s that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code 📝
